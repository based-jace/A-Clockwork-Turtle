# A-Clockwork-Turtle
Made in 11 hours in Python's built-in vector graphics program (Turtle). 

The goal of the project was to make something (anything) using Turtle. Most people's go-to was to experiment a little with Python's random function creating semi-random geometric designs. I thought, "Hey. I want to re-create a still from A Clockwork Orange." So that's what I did. 

My first order of business was to open up VLC along with the movie, and then I took a screenshot of the clip I wanted to use. 

My first attempt was to sort of eyeball it, but that proved to be ugly and time-consuming (not that the final product wasn't time consuming in itself).

I opened up that screenshot in Photoshop, and then I realized that the coordinates 0,0 in Photoshop were in the top left of the screen, whereas 0,0 in Turtle was directly in the center. I then thought to myself, "How am I going to reconcile this?" Soon after I realized I could easily write a program that would essentially just convert the Photoshop coordinates where I had the mouse cursor placed into Turtle graphics coordinates. Throughout the night I worked on the picture, I also gradually improved upon the program to what it is now, being able not only to convert coordinates, but also automatically write the code for each individual geometric shape, making the entire process, although tedious and time consuming, exponentially more efficient.
